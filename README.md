# django_blog

Here is my first prototye's blog with django.
go to www.fjr.pythonanywhere.com to see how it looks.
added several features, which you can see on blog/models.py

I'm don't really know about UI, so i use little bit bootstrap.

And thanks djangogirls.org with your awesome tutorial. It teach me alot.

Will create more
